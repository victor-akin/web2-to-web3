### This app shows the migration from web2 to web 3 with a simple app

### How the repo is organized

- The repo has 3 other branches apart from main
  - `task-one` (Web2, a typical centralized app.)
  - `task-two` (Web3, go decentralized.)
  - `task-three` (Challenge codes.)
  - `main` will have the final version off the app which is same as branch `task-three`
